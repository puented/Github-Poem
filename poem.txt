Experiment in Github Repo Poetry

Ode to a Repo:
Repo,
Repo,
This is
a Repo...

Do you want to commit to this repo?
I don't know?
Ok!

Let's commit to this
Repo!

Repo!
Repo!
REPO!
Is this the real life...
Is this just fantasy?

They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
